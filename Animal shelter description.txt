I would like to have an app for managing a pet shop.
On the main screen I want to have a list of animals and a button to add a new animal.
Each list member should have a picutre of the animal and some details of the animal: name, age, breed.
Also, when click on an element of the list I would like to open a new page on which I can see and modify the details
of the animal. Moreover, I want to have a short description for it. Also, on this page I would like to have a button to remove the animal 
from the list when it is sold.

Entity:
Animal:
	-> name: 		string
	-> age: 		unsigned int
	-> breed: 		string
	-> description: string
	-> image_path:	string
	
CRUD:
	-> add/create: creates and adds a new Animal to the pet shop
	-> delete:     deletes an Animal from the shop when it is sold
	-> read:	   view the list of Animals
	-> update:	   update some fields of an Animal
	
All the CRUD operations will be persisted on the local db and on the server.

If the device is offline, the app sould still be connected to the local db and, 
after it is connected to the server again, the local db should sync with it.

On update and delete - a message will be displayed, that the application is offline and the operation is not available. 
On read 			 - the content from the local database will be displayed, with a note that the server connection is down.
On add/create 		 - the input will be persisted in the local database and when the application will detect that the device is able
					   to connect again to the server will push only the created entries, while the device was offline.
